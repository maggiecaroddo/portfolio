                        Q: So you toured several cities in the northeast this past summer. What was your favorite one? (It better be New York.)
                        <br>A: It think New York was far and away our worst show. It was slightly disappointing because obviously you have this perception about New York- you expect it to be this insane, huge thing. We got really good bands on there but it was a Sunday night and it wasn't promoted as well as some of our other shows. I think Boston was definitely my favorite. We played this place called the Furry Frat. You kinda walk in being like “What the hell is going on here? Is something bad going to happen to me?” Luckily everything was super chill.
                        <br><br>Q: Do you find the music you grew up listening to influences the music you make now?
                        <br>A: Oh, yeah. I think I'm maybe moving away from that a little bit now but for my basis the strongest influences are gonna be 90s indie and guitar rock. I'm always just attracted to pop songs structures with like loud and weird guitars. I'm not married to all of that, though. Maybe in 5 years I'll be making straight ahead folk. Probably not, but there's no way for me to say definitively.
                        <br><br>Q: What would you say is the ideal listening environment for Rufus Cesspool music?
                        <br>A: I think I mixed the EP such that it's ideal for headphones. But I hesitate to lean too heavily towards that because people will release something that sounds kinda shit but they're just like “Bro you just gotta get a really good pair of headphones and go home like I promise bro it sounds great.” Realistically if you're making good sounding music you should be able to listen to it in your car because that's an acoustically really terrible environment. And I have and it sounds pretty good in there, so I feel good about that. I think headphones are ideal if you want to get the full sonic experience.
                        <br><br>Q: What Montreal artists would you most like to collab with?
                        <br>A: I think I really have a ton of respect for the musical and aesthetic style of Piss for Pumpkin, of course. That's a pretty clear one. We're playing with this band Pressure Pin soon. But it's different in the “indie world” - I kind of hate that word - it's not like rap where people will throw verses on each other's songs. That comes really naturally to that genre. I think in terms of the music I'm making it's more in terms of individual musicians I really respect who I want on my tracks. In terms of the wider world of music, Drake, hahah. There's this dude Chris Weisman from Brattleboro, Vermont who writes really cool songs. I want to collab with him.
                        <br><br>Q: What's your song-making process like?
                        <br>A: It used to be this entirely solitary thing where I'd just come up with a guitar riff then figure out where it goes from there and just write a bunch of guitar parts. I would them stitch them together in a structure I find interesting. Then, use that as a scratch track, record drums and base, then do vocals last. But that's not always how it is. The song “Collage Rock” I wrote guitar and vocals first and then wrote the second part on piano because it's sort of a more freeing thing for reharmonizing parts. Now, I'm honestly figuring it out. I have a band and we're sort of figuring out our collective writing process, which is obviously going to change my personal writing process. I'm very into the idea of including them on writing stuff more.
                        <br><br>Q: What kind of stuff did you listen to growing up?
                        <br>A: For a long time I only listened to the Beatles. I think it was the easiest thing to latch onto so I just got completely obsessed and knew all of their songs. That's how I learned guitar - I had this Beatles song book with 200 songs so I'd play all of them. Then I got really into dubstep as a lot of 10 year olds do. Then I heard “Bright in the Corners” in the car by Pavement when I was 11 and that's when I started getting into music that was not the Beatles or dubstep. I remember walking around a flea market singing “Shady Lane” by Pavement, which got me into 80s and 90s guitar rock, leading into my math rock phase. Newer bands like Speedy Ortiz which is relevant because they're from Western Mass so I got to be like “Oh, these guys are from here!”
                        <br><br>Q: How old were you when you properly learned to play guitar?
                        <br>A: I got my first guitar when I was like 8 and started taking lessons and stuff. I had like one of those chord charts on my wall and I would just play the cords. But I would say I got decent at it when I was like 13 or 14. That's a pretty important taste-making age, and that was when I first started recording my own music. A lot of that sort of show offy math guitar rock definitely catalyzed me to become a better guitarist. Bands like Chon.
                        <br><br>Q: Do you have any tips for musicians trying to break into the music scene, more specifically in Montreal?
                        <br>A: I would say make sure whoever you're playing with, you really enjoy being around for long stretches of time. I would also say booking shows is really intimidating at first but ultimately there's kind of a formula to it. A lot of times venues prefer simplicity. Just tell them what you can bring, and if it's nothing, you might get booked anyway. A lot of the logistical stuff was really hard for me at first because I don't really think of myself as someone who is amazing at reaching out to people or to venues. But it's gotten a lot easier. Book shows, because they're fun and they make you a better musician.
