                        <b>I. Introduction</b>
                        <br><br>In 1947, after 89 years of colonial rule at the hands of the British
                        Empire, British India was partitioned along religious lines into the
                        independent nation states of India and Pakistan. East Bengal - known as East
                        Pakistan up until 1971 - had a Muslim majority, and thus aligned itself with
                        Pakistan, while West Bengal, having a Hindu majority, remained with India.
                        This generated a colossal refugee crisis, with thousands of Hindu Bengalis
                        fleeing East Bengal for West Bengal. The majority of post-Partition
                        filmmakers opted not to tackle the sensitive topic of Partition and its violent
                        aftermath, as it was a history that was still unfolding (Ahmed 2015). However,
                        Rhitwik Ghatak, a Bengali filmmaker forcibly exiled to West Bengal after
                        Partition, dedicated his entire career to highlighting the horrid outcome of
                        Indian Independence, notably the catastrophic Partition of Bengal (Levich
                        1997). Ghatak's portrayal of the impact of Partition on Bengali society is
                        illuminated in his film Meghe Dhaka Tara (1960), which follows a displaced
                        Bengali family residing in a refugee camp near Calcutta. In this essay, I will
                        argue that through the inclusion of traditional Bengali melodies dealing with
                        pain and suffering, Ghatak's film is not only aesthetically enticing but also
                        underlines the fallout of Partition exclusively on Bengali terms.
                        <br><br><b>II. Realities of the Partition of Bengal</b>
                        <br><br>The 1947 Partition culminated in the unidirectional flow of thousands
                        of migrants from East Bengal to West Bengal. This migration crisis was
                        triggered by the persecution of the Hindu minority population at the hands of
                        the East Pakistani administration in the form of a partisan police force, rumors
                        of minority massacres, arbitrary requisition of the minorities' houses, and
                        perpetual anti-Hindu propaganda produced by the press and media to provoke
                        the masses against the Hindu population (Ghosh 2013). Consequently,
                        Bengal's once highly praised cultural unity lay in shambles, as society became
                        increasingly plagued by sectarian sentiments and violence.
                        <br><br>Furthermore, Bengalis whose roots lay in East Bengal but now lived
                        in West Bengal had to witness part of their homeland become a foreign
                        country (Dass 2010). Despite the widespread violence and displacement
                        prompted by Partition, many popular Bengali melodramas in the post-
                        Partition era have tended to put forth narratives of self-growth associated with
                        the construction of the modern Indian citizen. Many narratives also
                        romanticize Partition, viewing it as a historically destined event necessary for
                        India's Independence (Carrigy 2010). However, being a refugee of Partition
                        himself, Ghatak viewed India's Independence as betrayal and sought to resist
                        the nationalistic appropriation of Bengali suffering that was depicted as
                        unavoidable and even meaningful (Raychaudhuri 2009).
                        <br><br><b>III. The Political Power of the Soundtrack</b>
                        <br><br>At the surface level, Ghatak's employment of alluring melodies
                        within the film's soundtrack adds to the aesthetic appeal of the film.
                        However, given that Ghatak proclaimed that the film's “aboriginal songs
                        have been used with a purpose,” it is crucial to note the sociopolitical
                        implications of the soundtrack, specifically how they connect to preserving
                        a Bengali identity against the backdrop of the horrors of Partition (Ghatak
                        16). One such song that Ghatak weaved into the film to accentuate the
                        trauma of Partition is Kandiya Akula ha'ilāma (“I was crying”). Performed by
                        a man sitting by the river, the song speaks of a person on a riverbank who
                        does not know the name of the boatman he sees and therefore cannot call
                        him to travel to the other side of the river (see Figure I). The palpable
                        desperation of the song's narrator to get to the other side of the river adopts
                        a new meaning when set against the context of Partition. Similar to how the
                        narrator will always be searching for a way to cross the river, those who lost
                        their homes in the wake of Partition will forever be searching into the void
                        for another place to call home. By featuring this melodious tune, Ghatak
                        elevates the experiences of those who did not feel at home in independent
                        India, undermining the notion that Partition yielded an egalitarian liberaldemocratic
                        state (Dass 2010).
                        <br><br>Another song that Ghatak includes to reckon with the weight of
                        Partition is Je rate more duarguli bhanglo jhare (“The night the storm tore down
                        my door”). This song is performed by Shankar and Nita after Shankar
                        informs Nita of his decision to leave the household to protest the family's
                        treatment of her. The song was originally composed by Rabindranath Tagore,
                        a key figure in the early-twentieth-century Bengali Renaissance. The lyrics
                        tackle intense suffering and desolation, all while evoking images of
                        destruction in the wake of a storm to illustrate these themes of hardship.
                        While the song is primarily focused on suffering, it holds that there is hope
                        of eventual transcendence through adversity. As the song draws to a close,
                        Nita grabs her neck with her hands in a painful gesture and appears to gasp
                        for air. For the first time in the film, she breaks down in tears, doing away
                        with any hope offered in the song (see Figure II). The suffering outlined in the
                        song followed by Nita's breakdown encapsulates the devastating plight of
                        Bengali refugees, true to Ghatak's ambition to express the agonies of fellow
                        Bengalis who were impacted by Partition (Ahmed 2015). Furthermore, as
                        noted by Manishita Dass, Tagore's songs were an essential fixture of the
                        everyday lives of middle-class Bengali families. Thus, the inclusion of this
                        song serves not only to comment on the trauma of being a refugee of
                        Partition but also to highlight a work of art that is unmistakably Bengali, a
                        crucial characteristic in a time when many Bengalis experienced a drastic loss
                        of culture and identity (Dass 2010).
                        <br><br>An additionally quintessential Bengali song that Ghatak features to
                        touch upon the pain of Partition refugees is Ai go Uma, kole ai (“Come, my
                        daughter Uma”). It marks the time when the Hindu goddess Uma is meant to
                        return to the home of her in-laws. Through Nita, Ghatak attempts to
                        demonstrate an allegorical connection with Uma, the archetype of all
                        daughters and brides of Bengali households in Hindu mythology. It is played
                        at the end of the film to signify Nita's death when Shankar returns from
                        visiting her at the sanatorium (see Figure III). By connecting Nita with a goddess
                        popularly worshiped in Bengal, her death is one of mythological martyrdom
                        and self-sacrifice, representative of the pain and suffering of an entire nation
                        and not just an individual (Ahmed 2015). Furthermore, Ghatak professed that
                        this song was utilized to convey his desire for the union of the two Bengals
                        and to voice that this desire remains unfulfilled (Carrigy 2010).
                        <br><br><b>IV. Conclusion</b>
                        <br><br>As Ghatak once asserted, “all art has aesthetic relish coursing through
                        multiple layers…If we delve a little deeper, we find the political and social
                        connotations at play” (Ghatak 13). Through crafting a sonically beautiful yet
                        politically poignant soundtrack in Meghe Dhaka Tara, Ghatak explores the
                        displacement, social disintegration, and historical trauma of the aftermath of
                        Partition in a uniquely Bengali way, rebuking nationalist myths of Indian
                        Independence that have often been propagated by other filmmakers (Dass
                        2010).
