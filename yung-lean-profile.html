                        If you're familiar with Yung Lean, the 27-year-old Swedish rapper who first went viral on YouTube in 2013, you've probably heard Ginseng Strip 2002, the song that propelled him to international fame when he was just 16. Or maybe you know him from his work with Sad Boys, a music collective closely associated with fellow Stockholm artists Bladee, Thaiboy Digital, and Ecco2k. But did you know that Lean has an alter ego with four full-length studio albums?
                        <br><br>Born in 1996 in Minsk, Belarus, Jonatan Aron Leandoer Håstad has been continuously hustling from a young age. Making his first mixtape at just 11 years old, Lean has drawn influence from rap greats like Nas, Gucci Mane, and 50 Cent. His first proper microphone was purchased after countless hours of flipping Big Macs at McDonald's and cleaning toilets at a swim club in Southern Stockholm. 
                        <br><br>After several years of rapping as Yung Lean, Håstad began to also put out music in 2016 under the alter ego jonatan leandoer96. A significant departure from the vaperwave, occasionally goofy music that he produces as Yung Lean, his music as jonatan leandoer96 adopts a much more subdued, melancholic tone. While he certainly hasn't strayed away from rapping about more emotional topics as Yung Lean, as evidenced by songs like “Agony” and  “Red Bottom Sky,” 
                        <br><br>“Sugar World,” released by jonatan leandoer96 in 2023, truly encapsulates the artistic range that Håstad is able to demonstrate through his alter ego. Beginning with “Nightmare Amusement Park,” a guitar riff-infused rock banger, the album ends with “July,” a euphoric pop track that sounds like it was pulled straight from the soundtrack of an early 2000s indie movie. The song that will be most surprising to those who are only familiar with Håstad's rap music is “Open (Copenhagen Freestyle),” a melodious piano ballad that interpolates “Every Breath You Take” by The Police. 
                        <br><br>A testament to his robust work ethic, jonatan leandoer96 isn't even the only alter ego that Håstad releases music under. As Död Mark, which he's released two albums under, Håstad collaborates with producer Yung Gud to craft catchy grunge tunes in their native language of Swedish. With a discography spanning several genres and personalities, Yung Lean gives critics a friendly reminder that Arizona Iced Tea and Oreo Milkshakes are far from the only thing he's able to make music about.
